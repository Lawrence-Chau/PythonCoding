##The first thing we need to do is access some packages so we use their built in functions. 
import requests
import random 

##Let's connect the [list] of Jeopardy to our code.
list_of_jeopardy = requests.get('http://jservice.io/api/clues?category=139').json()

#Check the connection by seeing how LONG my list is--how many questions there are.
length = len(list_of_jeopardy)
print(length)
##Let's see if we can get the first question (then after, its answer).

print(list_of_jeopardy[0]['question'])
print(list_of_jeopardy[0]['answer'])
##Let's see if we can get a random number so that each time our index number is different and we get a different question.
random_number = random.randint(0, length - 1)
print(random_number)

##Use my random number as the index number so every time I run I get a different question.

print(list_of_jeopardy[random_number]["question"])
right_answer = (list_of_jeopardy[random_number]["answer"])

#random_number generates and stores it on each run

##Now we will show the user a random question AND get their USER INPUT!

#user will put their answer in the variable below:

user_response = input('Enter your answer:')


if user_response == right_answer:
  print(f'you are correct')
else:
  print(f'you are wrong')
